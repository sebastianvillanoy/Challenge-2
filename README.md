# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project
<p>
The study looked at a dataset of daily volume traded and daily closing prices of 12 green energy stocks in the years 2017 and 2018. The analysis utilized VBA Macros to efficiently calculate the total volume of trades for each stock in a given year. The annual return for each stock was also determined by measuring the growth of its closing price from the start of year to the end of the year.

The goal is to help investors determine whether DAQO New Energy corporation (ticker: DQ), a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels, is worth investing in.

</br>
<p>
In 2017, all of the green energy stocks in the dataset experienced a positive annual growth with the exception of TERP whose stock price decreased by 7.2%. This trend indicates that 2017 is a genrally lucrative year for investing in companies that produce green energy. With a 199.4% growth rate since the beginning of the year, the DQ stock price has almost tripled its initial value by the end of 2017. However, DQ also has the lowest total trading volume in 2017 among the stocks in the dataset. Investors who buy low volume stocks may find it difficult to sell it later because of the lack of liquidity.

</br>
<p>
Most of the green stocks that experienced a positive growth in 2017 decreased in value in 2018. Among them is DQ which exhibited a 62.6% decline in value by the end of 2018. Considering its contrasting  performance in 2017, DQ stock price behaviour is extremely volatile. Along with its low liquidity from its low trading volume, DQ stock can be a risky investment. Therefore, investors should strongly consider diversifying their portfolio of green investments to other comapanies such as ENPH and RUN. Both of their stock prices experienced consecutive positive growth rates in 2017 and 2018. This suggests that investors have a sustained optimistic outlook regarding the future cash flows of these comapanies. In addition, both of these stocks have a higher trading volume relative to the others. This implies that investors can easily resell these stocks in an active trading market and quickly realize any potential gains.
